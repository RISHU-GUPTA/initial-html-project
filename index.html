            </p> <p>Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can shop online using a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.</p>
		    
            <h2>How does online shopping work</h2>
            <p>
                Above all, you will need an Internet connection, a debit or credit card, and a secure password. You may also need to have an email address or mobile phone number.Most retailers will allow you to make up your password. Make sure it is a password that nobody could guess. Avoid your birthdate and those of relatives. Ideally, you should include a combination of letters, numbers, and higher and lower cases.You then scroll through the items the retailer is offering. Sometimes they will have a category list, such as furniture, sports equipment, gardening, etc.Most retailers also have a search facility. This means that you can write the name of the item you seek to determine whether they have it.
